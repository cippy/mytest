When I have a git repository with subdirectories, I can use:

$ git add <file_name>
$ git commit -m "message"

from that directory.
Then, after pushing (from the directory where .git is present) with:

$ git push origin master

I will find that my remote repository has the same filesystem as in my local, that is, a file committed in a directory called "dir" will be found in a directory with the same name in my remote repository.
